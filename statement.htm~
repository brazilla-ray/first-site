	Painting imitates. What painting imitates is not so much nature as other
	human activities. Painting is like poetry, it is like music, it is
	like fiction, history, and science. Much of the period known as
	Modernism was spent, at least according to some, asserting
	painting's uniqueness, especially by emphasizing its flatness. But
	the profusion of styles and approaches to painting that flourished
	in the twentieth century has demonstrated that painting can function
	in many different modes, from lyrical abstractions to prose-like
	conceptualism. Painting is always just itself in the end, not
	exactly like anything else, but the painter can draw on as wide a
	range of influences as he or she can find a use for, therefore
	pushing it towards one or another type of intellectual activity. The
	uniqueness of painting then, lies not so much in its flatness or in
	any other pictorial quality, but in the opportunity it affords the
	painter to express a broad engagement with the world, from the
	sensual to the abstract.

	It is sometimes said painting as an art has nothing left to explore.
	This can only be true if one adopts dogmatic views of what painting
	is or isn't. If one accepts that painting can be many things, even
	(especially!) contradictory things, possibilities will always exist.
